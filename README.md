# 🎧 Terminal Book Reader – Python Text-to-Speech Narrator

A simple, offline terminal-based tool to **read and listen to any `.txt` book or text file** — with voice narration and slow-print terminal animation.

---

## 📖 Why I Built This

While traveling in a **crowded metro**, I tried reading a physical book — but it was nearly impossible to hold and read due to the rush. I wished I had an audiobook version, but sadly, the book didn’t have one.

So I thought, **why not build my own tool that reads any text file aloud?**

This project was born right there — to convert plain `.txt` files into an immersive voice + text experience, all inside the terminal.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Text-to-Speech using `pyttsx3` (offline, no internet needed)
- ✅ Smooth terminal animation using a custom `slow_print()`
- ✅ Real-time multithreaded voice and text rendering
- ✅ Option to replay the content after it finishes
- ✅ Clean and minimal interface
- ✅ Reads any UTF-8 `.txt` file

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- `pyttsx3` – for offline speech synthesis
- `threading` – to play voice and print text simultaneously
- ANSI Escape Codes – for terminal coloring (optional)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/terminal-book-reader.git
cd terminal-book-reader
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pyttsx3
```

> Optionally install `colorama` if you're on Windows and want colored terminal output:
```bash
pip install colorama
```

---

## 📂 Usage

1. Place your `.txt` file inside the `book_reading/` folder.
2. Make sure the file is named `input.txt` or change the path in the code.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python reader.py
```

4. Enjoy the experience!
5. When done, it will ask if you'd like to replay the content.

## 📝 Example Content

This demo uses **"The Man in the Arena"** by Theodore Roosevelt:

> "*The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena...*"  
> *(Full quote inside `input.txt`)*

You can replace it with any motivational text, story, or personal writing of your own.

## 💡 Ideas for Future Improvements

- Add background music
- Create a GUI version (Tkinter or PyQT)
- Support `.pdf` to `.txt` conversion
- Export as `.mp3` audiobook
- Sentence-by-sentence narration highlighting
